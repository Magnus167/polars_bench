# benching a lazy query on polars:python

polars provides a fast lazy query engine for dataframes. This is a benchmark to see how fast it is.

Currently running the bench on a 16GB dataset with 12000 * 100 * 10 * 10 = 120 million rows and 5 column = 600 million values.

- Took 15 seconds all in all... WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
